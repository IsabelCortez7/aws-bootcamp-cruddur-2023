# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

## Required Homework
### 1.1 Containerize Application (Dockerfiles)
We start with the Dockerfile below:

![Dockerfile](assets/Wk1Dockerfile.png)

Then, run Flask:
```
cd backend-flask
export FRONTEND_URL="*"
export BACKEND_URL="*"
python3 -m flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=4567
cd ..
```

Port 4567 should be running through Gitpod and once you unlock the port, you click on the URL and add ``` /api/activities/home ``` at the end.
You should see JSON as below:

![JSON](assets/Wk1Json.png)

To build the Docker container, run the following command:
```
docker build -t  backend-flask ./backend-flask
```

You can see the steps of the container being built like layers. The last lines confirm the container was successfully built.

The ``` backend-flask ``` and ``` python ``` images were built and are seen by running the command ``` python images ``` as below:

![Dockerimages](assets/Wk1Dockerimages.png)

Because the backend and frontend environment variables are already set in our local machine, we can run ``` docker run --rm -p 4567:4567 -it  -e FRONTEND_URL -e BACKEND_URL backend-flask ``` where ``` -e ``` will pipe them from our machine.

Port 4567 should be running through Gitpod and once you unlock the port, you click on the URL and add ``` /api/activities/home ``` at the end to see JSON

Next, you want to run the following commands:
``` 
cd frontend-react-js
npm i 
cd ..
```

Then, create a ``` Dockerfile ``` under ``` frontend-react-js ``` containing the following:
``` 
FROM node:16.18

ENV PORT=3000

COPY . /frontend-react-js
WORKDIR /frontend-react-js
RUN npm install
EXPOSE ${PORT}
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```
### 1.2 Containerize Application (Docker Compose)
First, I created a ``` docker-compose.yml ``` at the root of my project. With this, we are able to run multiple containers at the same time.

![DockerComposeFile](assets/Wk1DockerComposeFile.png)

Then, you right-click on the newly created yml file and click the command compose up. It's basically doing a docker build and docker run on both of the containers.

![Dockercomposeup](assets/Wk1Dockercomposeup.png)

You should see port 4567 and port 3000 running. Make sure to unlock both of them.

![OpenPorts](assets/Wk1OpenPorts.png)

If you click port 3000, you should see the home page below. This means that the front end and back end are communicating and multiple containers are running.
